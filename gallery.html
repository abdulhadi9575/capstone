        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with a dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets. Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>
        <img class="myslides" src="Leonardo_Phoenix_Depict_a_breathtaking_cloudswirled_Jupiter_fr_3.jpg" style="height: 400px">
        <p>Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar system – if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside. It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago.</p>
        <img class="myslides" src="mars.jpeg" style="height: 550px"><p>Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.</p>
        <img class="myslides" src="Mercury_in_true_color.jpg" style="height: 550px"><p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.</p>
        <img class="myslides" src="neptune.jpg" style="height: 385px"><p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth. Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.</p>
        <img class="myslides" src="p0257vk5.jpg" style="height: 400px"><p>Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28 small moons. Uranus rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.</p>
        <img class="myslides" src="venus.jpeg" style="height: 300px"><p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin.</p>
        <img class="myslides" src="Leonardo_Phoenix_Create_a_breathtakingly_stunning_image_of_our_0.jpg" style="height: 400px"><p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

            Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.</p>
